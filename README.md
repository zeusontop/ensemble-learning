 We found that the characteristics of different countries behave very differently, so we divided the data into two parts: fr and de. Done in the file Data_Preprocess.
	
 The file named adaboost uses the adaboost model to train and predict.

 The file named Random_Forest uses the random forest model to train and predict.

 The file named Xgboost uses the Xgboost model to train and predict.
	
The file named GradientBoostingRegressor uses the GradientBoostingRegressor model to train and predict.

The file named Electricity_Price_Competition_DesicionTreeRegressor uses the desicion tree model to train and predict.And we use its results to be the baseline.
